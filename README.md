# Physics Game

A fun and interactive physics-based game that challenges players with realistic mechanics, such as gravity, motion, and collision detection. This game encourages players to think strategically while exploring various levels designed with puzzles that can only be solved by understanding fundamental physics principles. Built with [insert tools, frameworks, e.g., Unity, C++/SFML], this project provides an engaging experience for users interested in both gaming and physics concepts.

Features:

Realistic physics simulation (gravity, friction, inertia)
Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
Dynamic obstacles and challenges
Score tracking and achievements
